# PornSort
Using the AnalyzeAdult endpoint of the Haystack API, PornSort can categorize porn images and sort them into folders. If the image contains no nudity, it is filed under the "clean" folder in the output directory. This is only a proof of concept but it could be easily adapted to use adult content detection to any program. In order to use this program you must aquire an API key from https://www.haystack.ai/
